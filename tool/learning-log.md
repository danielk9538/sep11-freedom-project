Tool: **Kaboom**

Project: **Platformer Game**

---

10/29/23:
* I watched a few videos on how kaboom can be used. Scrolled through both kaboom.js' library and playtested in Kaboom.js playground. I still haven't decided on what I want to create since I don't wanna find out it can't be done half way through.

11/05/23:
* I created a sandbox map with the ability for a character to move around using WASD. Scrolling the Kabooms library to find which code fits what i need.

* I used a preexisting platformer game with variety of creations (blockgame which allows you to free build on 2d platform) With refrence i reshaped the map to look identical or simillar.

* Attempt at making an animated sprite when moving around.I made changes to my map to be more specified to my planned map. I then drew a sprite with a few animations and put them on a spritesheet. Originally I thought I could make the sprite appear when a key is pressed and it returns on release but that hasn't worked out. I still yet managed to get the sprite to animate because I'm receiving errors when interperting code from youtube videos. I still plan to make another animation for another sprite (venus flytrap, mouth open/closing). I also am trying to create a way for damage blocks that push you away (knockback) without instantly elimating the player, aswell as add sound to the game such as jumping, background, and etc. Refactored my movement code.
